- **Added** : Optional feature `ternary-store` with structures `DataTernary` and `TritsChunk`.
- **Added** : `dter()` function.
- **Updated** : `repr(u8)` for `Digit` to manipulate ternary numbers with a lower memory footprint.

> The primary goal of this version is to optimize the memory footprint of ternary numbers.
>
> This can be achieved by:
> * Utilizing the `Ternary` struct to **perform operations** on ternary numbers,
> * And optionally leveraging the `DataTernary` struct to **store** ternary numbers efficiently.
>
> Alternatively, we can store our data directly in smaller types like `i64` and use the `from_dec()` and `to_dec()`
methods for conversions.
